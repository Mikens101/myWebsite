                        Throughout the 17 years of my life, I have been an active
                        <b>participant and leader</b> in my community; at a young
                        age, assisting at local soup kitchens and community gardens,
                        and later, my involvement in the <b>Boy Scouts of America.
                        </b> Scouting drove my passion for the outdoors. I became a
                        backpacking enthusiast and reached the achievement
                        of <b>hiking four state segments of the Appalachian Trail
                        </b> (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New
                        Hampshire), over 400 miles. After completing a community
                        service project —building a 45ft bridge at a local park— I
                        obtained the rank of <b>Eagle Scout in 2019,</b> and took on
                        high school. Being involved in many activities was hard to
                        balance with my rigorous course load; however, I managed to
                        arrange my schedule to allow me to participate in activities
                        where I could express my passions —especially engineering. My
                        participation in the local <b>Robotics Team</b> (Apple Pi
                        Robotics, FIRST Team 2067) and the <b>Guilford Science
                        Olympiad Team</b> (www.ghsso.org) strengthened my
                        knowledge of Science and Engineering, helping me solidify my
                        career aspirations in <b>Engineering and Computer Science.
                        </b> Currently, I am a senior at Guilford High School (Guilford,
                        CT) and will be graduating this upcoming spring (June 2023).
                        With the stress of senior year, music has helped me express
                        myself and allowed me to take a break from my course load as
                        lead trumpet in my high school Orchestra and Jazz band. As I
                        graduate high school and look forward to college, I cannot wait
                        to explore my field of interest and begin my journey.

                    <my-p>
                        As young adults, we judge the environment around us to decide what we value.
                        Morals aren't ideas that one is merely born with, but are shaped over time.
                        For me, my parents played a big role in forming my beliefs, exposing me to
                        cultural, religious, and political ideology that is prevalent today. Nevertheless,
                        it wasn't until my age caught up with my beliefs that I truly considered them morals.
                        Age is often neglected as a key component to one's morals. Wisdom. As I grew up,
                        experience of the “real world” allowed me to grasp what morality truly means.
                        <br><br>
                        Inspired by Alexander Hamilton's quote, “if you don't stand for something, you will
                        fall for anything,” I am the type of person who stands up for what I think is right,
                        whether that be the popular opinion or not. As I grew up, my understanding of Hamilton's
                        message changed similarly to that of my morals; it's not just standing for something,
                        it's believing in it and living by it. When one lives by their beliefs and morals, they
                        are often looked up upon as leaders. Respect. Remaining strong in what I believe in has
                        given me confidence and transformed me into someone who people respect.
                        <br><br>
                        One trait that I value the most is individuality. It is important to be yourself, to
                        be confident in your morals and beliefs. Today, there are many people who are satisfied
                        to stand with whatever is popular, at the moment following the crowd and not actually
                        believing in what they preach. I am not a follower; and I value those who show their true
                        selves. I am a leader.

                    <my-p>
                        Is it possible to make a round structure out of rectangular blocks?
                        To some it might seem impossible, but to my four-year-old mind, it was
                        not so difficult. Since a very young age, I have always been the type of
                        person to tinker with the objects around me, attempting to invent my own
                        unique structures. I was the kid who appeared to have it all figured out, and
                        shocked adults when telling them that I wanted to be an architect when I was
                        older. I am a student that is curious about everything. I am an innovator.
                        <br><br>
                        Curiosity. My desire to learn and explore is driven by my wonder of “is there
                        a better way?” Once I see a problem, I work until I figure out a solution --with
                        deeper research and concept designs. My passion led me to expand my abilities
                        both physically, building prototypes and robotic structures, and mentally,
                        strategically planning and approaching the problem. My curiosity influenced my
                        love for computer-aided design and solidified my enthusiasm toward engineering.
                        <br><br>
                        Passion. Many of the projects I take on, come from problems in the world that I
                        “need to solve;” the environment being a hot topic. During high school, I achieved
                        finalist for several projects in the Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair. My
                        passion to innovate has grown with each project. In my Sophomore year, I researched
                        renewable harvesting methods and presented my design of a multi-harvesting, ocean-
                        based, wave-powered system. In my Junior year, I dove into a more complex area of
                        alternative energy by designing a hybrid cargo ship with the ability to generate
                        electricity as it moved through the water.
                        <br><br>
                        These experiences, inspired by my four-year-old self's vision, make engineering
                        as my choice of focus a no-brainer; When can I start?

                        “One day, you'll leave this world behind, so live a life you will remember.” Like other kids, I never
                        truly understood the significance of the lyrics of “The Nights” by Avicii; however, over time I've come
                        to realize if I live in constant fear of society's disapproval, I will never live my “true” life.
                        <br><br>
                        Live life to the fullest. It's sometimes hard to live in the moment; moving on from the past and unafraid
                        of the future. Throughout my life, I have dreaded my future in “adulthood,” not wanting to be stuck in a
                        cycle: wake up, go to work, go to sleep, repeat. After listening to Avicii's song, I realized that I must
                        live without fear and treasure the experiences as I go along before it is too late.
                        <br><br>
                        Be yourself. It is important to make your life your own, to be original. Since a young age, I have chased
                        my own dreams, driven by my own passions. Avicii's message is to live a life that is meaningful to you,
                        one that you will treasure forever. His lyrics inspire me to take risks, go out of my comfort zone, and
                        take advantage of the opportunities available to me.

                        I would travel to Albania. I am the grandson of an immigrant; many people don't know their family's history
                        or the sacrifices made by their ancestors. My maternal grandfather immigrated from Albania, a third-world
                        country in southern Europe, when he was six, in search of more opportunities to have a better life.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout my life, I have heard endless stories about life in Albania and family left behind. Growing up
                        in the United States had sheltered my view of how vastly different living conditions may be in other
                        countries. My grandfather's stories, shocking and sometimes horrifying me, made me realize that there are
                        other circumstances besides those that I face in the US.
                        <br><br>
                        I would also like to travel there to experience first-hand the traditions that I take part in; being an

                        the group in a positive direction; however, I am most involved in my high school's Science Olympiad Team.
                        I have been a leader for three years now: assistant captain in sophomore year, captain in junior year, and
                        build lead senior year.
                        <br><br>
                        Science Olympiad is unique because it allows students to explore subjects beyond the typical high school
                        curriculum. This activity has meant a lot to me because it provides an outlet for me to share my passion for
                        STEM with other students.

                        As a leader, it was always my goal to maintain the team, and ensure its longevity; accomplishing this by

                        expanding the size of the team from seven to twenty-eight members, designing a website from scratch for

                        a Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair project. What I love most about these projects is
                        that it gives me the opportunity to explore and have an impact on current issues —my favorite
                        being alternative renewable energy solutions.
                        <br><br>
                        Sophomore year (20-21), my project focused on the different renewable harvesting methods and
                        concluded with the “coral reef” design, an ocean-based, wave-powered multi-harvesting system.
                        With this project, I was selected as a finalist, and achieved first place in Alternative/Renewable
                        Energy Research --along with several other “special awards;” recognition from the NOAA and the Fox
                        Pest Control Award for Environmental Management.

                        Junior year (21-22), my project dove into a more complex area of alternative energy by attempting
                        to design a hybrid cargo ship with a goal of generating electricity from waves against the side of
                        a boat. Through research and experimentation, I discovered that the piezoelectric effect could be
                        applied here and designed a system around that principle. With this project, I was selected as a
                        finalist and achieved third place in Alternative/Renewable Energy Research --as well as recognition
                        from the Office of Naval Research, EnergizeCT Alternative Energy Award, Vanderbilt Chemicals, and a
                        significant scholarship from the University of New Haven.

                        I retraced the circuitry, still shaken by the events that had just taken place. White smoke began
                        flowing out of the robot, panic took over my body with beads of sweat rolling down my forehead. One
                        of my teammates yelled “turn it off,” but it was too late, the motor was fried. My four teammates
                        looked up at me in shock, waiting for instruction as we stood around our robot in disbelief.

                        To me, a successful college experience is one that provides opportunities to expand my knowledge
                        outside the classroom through real-life career experiences; working with a team through challenges
                        toward a common goal. Field experience versus classroom experience. Field experience allows me to
                        apply the skills learned in the classroom to projects in “real-life.” As research opportunities are
                        a big part of college, I look forward to being involved in these experiences as an outlet for my
                        passions and to further develop the skills I learn in class. The result, carving my career path to
                        reach my full potential and achieve my ultimate goals.
                        <br><br>
                        I have had many opportunities to explore my career path and its interdisciplinary nature as a member
                        of the local robotics team, which influenced my career aspirations in engineering and computer science.
                        I fell in love with robotics, design, and programming while working on robots and taking on challenges
                        throughout my four years of participation, and have become especially proficient in computer-aided design.
                        At the international PTC Challenge: Robots to the Rescue in 2020, competing against 150 others to design
                        a solution for a world-wide problem using computer-aided design, I led my team to achieve fifth place overall.
                        This experience confirmed my passion to design solutions for problems impacting society.

                        There is no better way to learn than diving right in and taking risks; learning by doing. When challenged
                        with difficult subject material, I'm motivated to ask more questions and ultimately discover better solutions.
                        The drive to conquer challenges pushed me to expand my knowledge and skills exceeding the high school curriculum.
                        This gave me the ability to achieve my goals in becoming proficient in several programming languages in less
                        than a year. I appreciate colleges' emphasis on challenging students to work past the classroom to become
                        leaders in their field of interest.

                        One of the most valuable lessons I learned as part of the robotics team is that it takes collaboration between different fields of science and engineering in order to design and create a successful product. Design. Build. Program.

                        Engineering is at the foundation of everything; designed and built to fit a specific need.
                        It maintains a clear intersection between almost all fields because of its central idea to
                        innovate. In fact, my passion for engineering doesn't come from my love for its principles,
                        but instead from its lessons of design, construction, and innovation of different things.
                        For me, the field of engineering is influenced by all of the other activities that I participate
                        in, from computer science to music.
                        <br><br>
                        Recently, I personally experienced this interdisciplinary connection that engineering has on
                        other fields by solving a problem that I was facing during a jazz band rehearsal. During this
                        rehearsal, a new piece of music was passed out and required a specific type of trumpet mute
                        known as a “bucket mute.” Searching through the pile of miscellaneous mutes, I found one bucket
                        mute, however, it did not attach like normal mutes and had metal clips to attach to the trumpet
                        bell. In examining this mute, I realized several flaws; the metal clips would scratch the lacquer
                        of the instrument, it was difficult to quickly attach and remove from the instrument --which was
                        required by the music--, and the overall price was extremely high.
                        <br><br>
                        In assessing the problem in front of me, I immediately began designing a new bucket mute that
                        could fit its purpose and be low cost. After conducting some research on this specific type of
                        mute, I discovered that there are not many variations of this insufficient design, and decided
                        to take matters into my own hands. With several prototypes and computer-aided design, I created
                        a functioning model that could be 3D printed; containing hooks that would slide onto the instrument
                        for quick transitions, and mimicking the same dull sound of the original mute. This project exhibits
                        the intersection between engineering and music, especially through its steps of addressing the problem
                        with research, design, prototyping, and improving the end product; similar to that of the engineering process.
                        <br><br>
                        The field of engineering provides me with the skills to approach and understand a problem from multiple
                        sides, which has strengthened my abilities both physically, building prototypes and robotic structures,
                        and mentally, strategically planning and approaching the problem. Over the past few years, I have followed
                        my passion to learn other skills influenced by engineering by taking several online courses; the most
                        recent being Harvard's online introduction to computer science, CS50. This course unlocked a new path for
                        me. With these interdisciplinary skills, it will allow me to integrate programming into my innovative ideas,
                        transforming them into functioning products.
                        <br><br>
                        Engineering is only one piece of the puzzle. Similar to the mute, there are many other problems I'd like to
                        solve using engineering. Engineering is the backbone to almost every field; it's innovations and solutions
                        advancing society.

                        Technology is something that we all take for granted, but never truly look into its full potential
                        as a tool. Our phones help us communicate, social media helps us connect, computers help us learn;
                        overall, everyone depends on technology as a resource of daily life. Without technology the world
                        would be further divided and society would not be as advanced as it is today.

                        Poverty is one of the most prevalent societal issues throughout the world today; however, a person
                        living in poverty does not necessarily lack abilities or is inferior. Technology has hidden potential
                        to solve world problems like poverty if only we stop and look closely. Specifically, electronic devices
                        can provide underprivileged students the needed access to resources that will help them learn and
                        compete with their peers from well-funded schools and towns.

                        Technology has opened up a path to learn new skills through Youtube, earn credits toward a degree from
                        online courses, and even promote your skills right from your fingertips. Khan Academy, one of the most
                        widely used platforms for k-12 students, is just one of the online resources that provides materials

                        I believe technology has the ability to help solve poverty because it gives people access to tools that

                        The environment is humanity's source of life; it is our responsibility to protect it
                        with our lives. In recent decades, human activity has caused significant carbon buildup
                        in our atmosphere, negatively impacting Earth's climate. Renewable technology such as
                        solar panels, wind turbines, and hydro-electric dams have been developed to minimize our
                        carbon footprint. However, current clean energy harvesters have common deficiencies; they
                        all depend on weather conditions and are unreliable. As conditions continue to worsen, it
                        becomes increasingly dire to find a solution, and I believe that solution lies in the
                        advancement of technology.

                        If you're like me, you enjoy ordering items from an online store like Amazon. The
                        ultimate convenience: things we want or need arriving at our doorstep with the click of a button.
                        Although this may appear to decrease carbon emissions by minimizing personal vehicle use, it simply
                        passes along the problem, in this case, to Amazon. The plague of convenience.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently we have not properly addressed this issue using methods insufficient to combat the rapidly
                        increasing carbon emissions into our atmosphere. Many people thought the introduction of electric cars
                        would significantly decrease carbon emissions. Although this is the right step toward a solution, it
                        just interchanges the plug; instead of a gas pump, an outlet --powered by fossil fuels! As a leading
                        world issue, limiting carbon emissions needs to be focused on industries that are the largest producers
                        of greenhouse gasses.
                        <br><br>
                        The root of the problem. Modern technology like cargo ships require a lot of energy to function, and
                        are one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions; each releasing up to four-hundred million
                        metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Previous presidents have taken action against fossil fuels,
                        imposing policies to restrict use of these major carbon emitters; however, the world economy cannot
                        survive without the shipping industry as it provides us with essential intercontinental trade. Right
                        now, I believe that we need to focus more on developing technology to provide better alternatives to
                        reduce emissions. We cannot simply shut down fossil fuel use. We must develop effective means to solve
                        its inefficiencies. We must improve technology, not get rid of it.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout high school, I conducted several projects in which I designed possible methods to reduce
                        our carbon footprint as a step toward the solution. One of the projects focused on the different
                        renewable harvesting methods, comparing their efficiencies, strengths, and flaws; concluding with
                        the “coral reef” design, an ocean-based, wave-powered multi-harvesting system. This design harnesses
                        the energy of waves and provides an artificial coral reef habitat for ocean-life. Another project
                        researched a more complex area of alternative energy, attempting to design a hybrid cargo ship with a
                        goal of generating electricity from waves hitting against the side of a boat. Through research and
                        experimentation, I discovered that the piezoelectric effect could be applied here, and designed a
                        system around that principle.
                        <br><br>
                        It takes everyone. In order to truly solve this problem, it will take everyone, not just the United
                        States. That is why, if president, I would work with other world leaders to create a coalition with
                        the goal of advancing renewable technology, including China, Russia, and India who make up the top
                        percent of carbon emissions. As we all mutually thrive from the wellbeing of the Earth, it is important
                        that everyone is held accountable for reaching or surpassing an equilibrium of carbon emissions. Over
                        the past few years, the United States has been a leader in decreasing carbon emissions --as well as our
                        environmental impact as a whole-- but our actions alone have little impact on reversing the incoming crisis.
                        <br><br>
                        Past United States presidents have attempted implementing policies, signing agreements with other countries,
                        creating social awareness through their campaign, and prohibiting certain actions that harm the environment
                        like shutting down oil pipelines. However, all of these methods have failed for one reason: it is not
                        advancing our technology to provide better alternatives. There has to be a better way to deal with this.
                        As president, I would establish an alternative energy research institute as part of the world wide coalition.
                        Our goal: rapid development of advanced renewable energy technology.
                        <br><br>
                        With the ramifications of climate change heading toward us at full speed, I believe that the most effective
                        way to solve this problem is from its roots --advancing technology to be more efficient and harvest clean
                        energy to use-- and that it takes everyone. This is a worldwide problem that needs worldwide attention.
                        Technology is humanity's only hope; we need to start now or we may lose our source of life: the environment.
