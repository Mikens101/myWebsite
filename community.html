                    <p style="font-weight:600;">Bridge at Bittner Park</p>

                    <p>In searching for a project idea, I decided to incorporate my career interest of Engineering and Architecture,
                      leading me to take on the challenge of building a forty-five by four foot bridge at Bittner Park in Guilford, CT.
                      This project initially involved a lot of different calculations to determine the load capacity in order to ensure
                      hikers and equestrians' safety. The key objective of this project was to reduced erosion and runoff caused by
                      people forging the stream, and provide a new and safe way for people to cross a waterfall edge on an existing trail;
                      as an additional bonus, my bridge would also benefit a newly designed disc golf course that was being built at the park.</p>

                    <p>My main goal was to make a structure that would last; consulting with several architects in order to check my designs
                      and structure of the bridge. Some funding for this bridge was raised through a gofundme page and the rest was covered
                      by the Parks and Recreation department —coming out to about 50/50. This project was took well over 100+ hours to design,
                      propose, re-design, fundraise, and finally construct.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight:600;">A New Hybrid: Harnessing the Power of Friction</p>

                    <p>Climate Change has the world looking for clean and alternative energy solutions to problems such as global
                      warming. Although there have been many advancements in renewable technology, there have been few steps taken
                      to advance one of the main contributors of pollution: cargo ships.</p>

                    <p>Over 30 million tons of goods are shipped around the globe daily, and at any given time there are over 50,000 cargo
                      ships crossing the ocean. The purpose of this project is to improve the efficiency of cargo ships through a study
                      exploring an energy harvesting system that collects the energy generated between the hull of a ship and its
                      movement across the water.</p>

                    <p>In order to understand what a 'clean-energy'system would look like in a cargo ship, research was conducted on
                      different methods of generating electricity through the friction between two objects. What was found was
                      piezoelectric actuator discs --two metal plates with piezoelectric crystals in between--, which might be a viable
                      solution in the conversion of mechanical movements or pressure into electrical energy.</p>

                    <p>The results of these experiments found that this method was successful in generating small amounts of energy;
                      however, due to limitations of cost, scale, etc., more research is needed to examine the full potential of this form of
                      energy collection.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight:600;">Improving and Designing Renewable Technology</p>

                    <p>In recent decades, human activity has caused significant carbon dioxide buildup in our atmosphere and is
                      negatively impacting Earth's climate. Renewable technology such as solar panels, wind turbines, and
                      hydro-electric dams have been developed to minimize our carbon footprint. However, current clean
                      energy harvesters all have common deficiencies; all depend on weather conditions and are unreliable.</p>

                    <p>This project seeks to improve the design and efficiency of existing energy harvesting systems to generate
                      electricity with less dependency on weather. My analysis includes the average energy production and
                      consistency of the harvester, along with size, environment impact, and lifespan. The result is a harvesting
                      system, capturing energy from ocean waves and direct sunlight.</p>

                    <p>Average 10kW solar panel systems, costing $20,000, have the smallest footprint and the highest energy
                      conversion. Wind turbine's with a capacity of 2,000-3,000 kW costs $2.6-$4 million. Although wind
                      turbines are cheaper per kW and have an extensive lifespan, its average energy conversion efficiency is
                      30%-40%. While hydroelectric dams are the most consistent energy harvesters --producing 1,000-10,000
                      kW--, their costs soar as high as $4,500/kW and have a large impact on the environment.</p>

                    <p>After developing many CAD sketches, my final design is a multi-harvester system that includes 3
                      PowerBuoys joined through a main structure, three 10 kW solar panel networks integrated on “wings”
                      enabling optimal direction toward the sun, and storage capacity ranging from 50-150 kWh. Each
                      PowerBuoy is capable of producing 8.4 kWh on an average day.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight:600;">The Evergreen Woods Retirement Home Assistance Robot</p>

                    <p>Our robot design addresses the issue of social distancing in areas like retirement communities where person to person
                      contact is necessary for the wellbeing of residents. Specifically designed for the retirement community Evergreen Woods
                      but applicable to any other similar communities, our robot is designed to limit health care worker to patient contact to
                      limit any possible spread of the virus.</p>

                    <p>Our solution is to create a robot that can travel from apartment to apartment, bringing in pills and groceries and taking
                      out trash, as well as checking oxygen saturation, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and watching respiration rate.
                      The robot has medical instruments for each of these tests, as well as an ipad screen where a nurse and patient can have
                      a virtual meeting and the nurse can watch and check respiration rate.</p>
